Welcome to Lab 01 - Google Cloud Sign-Up
===

In this lab, we'll sign up with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for this workshop. You should sign up for a new account and utilize the $300 credit. Only new accounts can be supported by the workshop instructors as pre-existing accounts may have security or other restrictions which may otherwise prevent you from completing this workshop.

_Note: These steps may vary slightly based on your region / locality. If you've already completed this step, feel free to skip to the next lab!_
